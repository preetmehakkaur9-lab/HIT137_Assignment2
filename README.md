The code below is a recursive algorithm that uses turtle graphics to draw a geometric pattern consisting of a regular polygon (in this example, a square, with four sides) and recursively changes a side to form a more complicated shape. The main characteristics are a recursive indent_edge method that breaks each edge into three equal parts, a middle part of which is replaced with an inward-facing equilateral triangle, and repeats this process up to a given depth (which was set to 3), giving the complex snowflake pattern. The code includes a side length of 300 pixels. The design is visually appealing, with a centre focus on the screen, which follows the rules of the assignment and matches the output of the example. All the parameters are appropriately attended to to achieve an excellent display.
