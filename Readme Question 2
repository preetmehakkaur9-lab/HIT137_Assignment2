README – QUESTION 1

Program overview: This Python program reads a text file ("raw_text.txt"), encrypts its contents using a simple custom encryption method, writes the encrypted content to "encrypted_text.txt", then decrypts it to "decrypted_text.txt", and verifies that the decoded file matches the original.
 
 The program follows the assignment instructions exactly for encryption:
  Lowercase letters:
  - Letters in 'a' to 'm' are shifted forward by (shift1 * shift2) positions.
  - Letters in 'n' to 'z' are shifted backward by (shift1 + shift2) positions.
 
Uppercase letters:
  - Letters in 'A' to 'M' are shifted backward by shift1 positions.
  - Letters in 'N' to 'Z' are shifted forward by (shift2 squared) positions.
 
Other characters: 
All the Spaces, tabs, newlines, numbers, and special characters remain unchanged.
 
Program Functions:
Encrypt_char(char, shift1, shift2):
Encrypts a single character according to the rules above.
Decrypt_using_original(original_file, encrypted_file, output_file, shift1, shift2):
Decrypts the encrypted file by reversing the shifts applied to each character, using the original file to determine the correct shift.
Writes the decrypted content to "decrypted_text.txt".
Process_file(input_file, output_file, shift1, shift2, mode):
Reads a file, encrypts or decrypts it character by character, and writes the result to an output file.
Verify files(file1, file2):
Compares two files (normalizing line endings) and prints whether they exactly match.
 
Usage Instructions:
Place "raw_text.txt" in the same directory as the program.
Run the program.
When prompted, enter integer values for shift1 and shift2
The program will:
Encrypt the contents of "raw_text.txt" → "encrypted_text.txt"
Decrypt the encrypted file → "decrypted_text.txt"
Verify if ecryption matches the original file and display the result.
 
Output:
encrypted_text.txt: It contains the encrypted version of the original text.
decrypted_text.txt: The decrypted version should exactly match the original file.
Console messages indicating the success of encryption, decryption, and verification.
 Things to be noted:
 1. Ensure "raw_text.txt" is encoded in UTF-8.
 2. The program works reliably on Windows, Linux, or Mac.
 3. The decryption function requires the original file to correctly reverse the shifts, because the encryption depends on the original letter range (a–m, n–z, etc.).
